# TeaQnet: A Vision-Based Deep Learning Framework for Tea Quality Assessment

## Project Overview

**TeaQnet** is an advanced deep learning-based framework designed to assess the quality of tea leaves by analyzing their color characteristics. By leveraging **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, **region-based CNN (RCNN)** models, and **colorimetric evaluation**, TeaVision provides expert-level grading of tea samples in a standardized environment.

This research is aimed at improving the efficiency and objectivity of tea quality testing, making it easier for producers and quality assessors to maintain premium standards in the tea industry.

## Research Problem

Tea quality assessment traditionally relies on human experts who visually inspect tea samples. However, this process is subjective, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistencies. The goal of TeaVision is to automate the tea grading process using a computer vision-based approach that can evaluate tea based on color, ensuring objective and standardized assessments.
